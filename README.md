# ParseRoomScanXML
Sample code for parsing RoomScan XML in Microsoft C#

This project demonstrates how to parse XML output from RoomScan Pro and RoomScan LiDAR in C#.

It's a stripped-down copy of the code we use internally to perform transformations into a wide range of outputs such as IFC for Autodesk, Heat Loss Reports and many more.

A sample XML file is included, and you can make your own in RoomScan by choosing XML from the Advanced Export menu.
